What is Bitcoin LE?
----------------

Bitcoin LE is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin LE uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Bitcoin LE inherits most of its features from Bitcoin but introduces a new Proof of Work algorithm that drastically reduces the carbon footprint of mining activities. Bitcoin LE Core is the name of the open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Bitcoin LE Core software, see https://bitcoinle.org/en/download, or read the
[original whitepaper](https://bitcoincore.org/bitcoin.pdf).

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](../../releases) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Bitcoin Core.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

The developer mailing list should be used to discuss complicated or controversial changes before working
on a patch set.
